Configuring HsOpenSSL-0.11.3.2...
setup.EXE: Missing dependencies on foreign libraries:
* Missing (or bad) header file: openssl/asn1.h
* Missing C libraries: eay32, ssl32
This problem can usually be solved by installing the system packages that
provide these libraries (you may need the "-dev" versions). If the libraries
are already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the
flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where they are.
If the header file does exist, it may contain errors that are caught by the C
compiler at the preprocessing stage. In this case you can re-run configure
with the verbosity flag -v3 to see the error messages.
